# To resolve issues with your .gitconfig file, ensure it has the correct format.
# Here is a basic example of a .gitconfig file:

[user]
  name = suppa-r
  email = supparaffaele43@gmail.com

[core]
  editor = code --wait

[alias]
  st = status
  co = checkout
  br = branch
  cm = commit

# Save this file as .gitconfig in your home directory.
